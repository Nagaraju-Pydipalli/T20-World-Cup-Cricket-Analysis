# T20-World-Cup-Cricket-Analysis
End-to-end sports data analytics project. In this project, I'll cover web scraping (from the ESPN Cricinfo website), python, pandas, and Power BI to perform analyses on T20 world cup cricket data.

Problem Statement: This project is based on Anaylsis to find the best 11 players based on T20 ( Cricket World cup ) Data.

Created a Power BI report to identify top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by
scrapping data from espncricinfo with a Bright-data website tool, cleaning and
transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player performance
metrics.

Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories
(openers, middle order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers)
and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match. 

Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has 90% of chances to win the
game.
